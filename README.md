# Insurance-Premium-Default-Prediction



**Objective of the project**

Premium paid by the customer is the major revenue source for insurance companies. Default in premium payments results in significant revenue losses and hence insurance companies would like to know upfront which type of customers would default premium payments. 

The objective of this project us to:

1. Build a model that can predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on premium payments (Who is likely to default)

2. Identify the factors that drive higher default rate (Are there any characteristics of the customers who are likely to default?)

3. Propose a strategy for reducing default rates by using the model and other insights from the analysis (What should be done to reduce the default rates?)


**Task**

Predict the probability that a customer will default the premium payment, so that the insurance agent can proactively reach out to the policy holder to follow up for the payment of premium. 


**Data Information**

The data for this report was generated from historical data of customer base of the company. 

A sample of 79,853 customers were randomly chosen, with personal information relating to –

1. ID of customer

2. Percentage premium paid by cash

3. Age of customers

4. Income

5. Marital status

6. Vehicle owned – between 1 and 3

7. Late payment of premium – 3-6 months; 6-12 months; more than 12 months

8. Risk Score – Higher scores are better

9. Number of dependants – Between 1 and 4

10. Accommodation – Owned (1), Rented (0)

11. Number of premiums paid till date

12. Sourcing Channel – How customers were acquired

13. Residence Area Type – Urban or Rural

14. Total premium paid

15. Default – 0 indicates that customer has defaulted the premium and 1 indicates that customer has not defaulted the premium


There are 17 variables presented with Default being the predicted variable. That is, 17 columns and 79,853 rows in total. Each row represents a single customer.
