# Insurance-Premium-Default-Prediction


**Task**

Predict the probability that a customer will default the premium payment, so that the insurance agent can proactively reach out to the policy holder to follow up for the payment of premium. 

**Introduction**

Premium is the major source of income for insurance companies, without which their liquidity could be threatened. Therefore, companies need to mitigate the risk of payment defaults. To do this, it becomes imperative that insurance companies are able to identify what kinds of customers are likely to default and significant factors that affect them.
Hence, the goal of this report is to study historical data of the company, garner useful insights through various visualization techniques, develop a model that predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting, and proffer strategic recommendations the company can use to minimize default.
